We can make a convex mirror by curving a plane mirror so its surface is
convex (“flexed out”) as in Fig. 34-8c. Curving the surface in this way (1) moves
the center of curvature C to behind the mirror and (2) increases the field of view.
It also (3) moves the image of the object closer to the mirror and (4) shrinks it.
Store surveillance mirrors are usually convex to take advantage of the increase in
the field of view—more of the store can then be seen with a single mirror.
